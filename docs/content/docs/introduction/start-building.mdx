## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - I recommend using Docker, but it's up to you.


## Initialize your project

```bash
bun create buncn
```

## Setup environment variables

```bash
cd {project_name}
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

Edit the `apps/api/.env` file to match your environment.

## Setup database

After setting up your environment variables, pointing DATABASE_URL to your <strong className="font-bold">existing PostgreSQL database</strong>, you can migrate your database:

```bash
bun run migrate
```

Executing this command in the project root will navigate to the apps/api directory and run the same command there.

There, it will run the Better Auth generation script to ./src/db/auth.schema.ts and then run the Drizzle push command to create the tables in your database.
