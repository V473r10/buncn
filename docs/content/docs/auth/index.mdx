## Introduction

Buncn comes with a seamlessly integrated authentication system built on top of [Better Auth](https://betterauth.dev).

There a few features pre configured, soon there will be more:

### Email & Password

Users can create an account and sign in using their email and password.

### Two Factor Authentication

Users can enable two factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to their account.

Go to `src/app/user/user-settings` to see the user settings page code.  

<p className="flex items-center gap-2">Users can access this feature from the Users menu in the sidebar under the <UserCircle2 /> Account item</p>
